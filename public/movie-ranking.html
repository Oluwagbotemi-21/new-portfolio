<h1>The Best chracters in the bible</h1> 
<h2>My best three chracters in the bible</h2>
 <hr>

 <h3>Jesus</h3>
<p>I love Jesus because he love me more than I love him, and he also came to die for my sins</p> 
<h3>Apostle Paul</h3>
<p>I like apostle paul because of how he properly expounded the gospel unto the siants
    of the churches in the bible.  He  was given so much revelation that has built the church today.

<h3>Elijah</h3>
<p>He was a fire branded prophet</p>
